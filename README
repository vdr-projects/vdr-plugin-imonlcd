Description:
------------
imonlcd is a plugin for the Video Disc Recorder and shows information
about the current state of VDR on iMON LCD.


Install LIRC kernel module lirc_imon:
-------------------------------------
You need installed kernel module lirc_imon installed to use the iMon LCD.
This module are provided by LIRC (which will also allow you to use the IR 
receiver that is built into the screen).

Other software like LCDproc should not be used, it could locking the 
device access. 

Install LIRC
A newer or current CVS version of LIRC is required for support of the iMON LCD.
You need to have the CVS client installed and then you can issue the following 
commands:

#> cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@lirc.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lirc login
#> cvs -z8 -d:pserver:anonymous@lirc.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lirc co lirc
#> cd lirc
#> ./autogen.sh
#> ./setup.sh

If you have any errors at this point, make sure you've installed all the 
prerequisite build tools. At this you'll be at the "setup" menu for LIRC. 
You'll need to choose "Driver Configuration" then 
  
  "USB Devices" then "Soundgraph iMON IR/LCD". 

Choose OK, then "Save configuration & run configure" to run the configure script. 
Once that finishes, run the following commands to install the modules:

#> make
#> make install
#> modprobe lirc_imon

At this point, you've got LIRC installed, and you might like to take some time
to set up your remote (if you've got one). 

That step is outside the scope of these instructions, so I'll just skip that 
and move on to install vdr-plugin-imonlcd now.


Install vdr-plugin-imonlcd:
---------------------------
Unpack the vdr-plugin-imonlcd tarball to $VDRSOURCE/PLUGINS/src directory.
Variable $VDRSOURCE stands for a directory, where source archive of VDR package 
was be decompressed.

#> cd $VDRSOURCE/PLUGINS/src
#> tar -xzvf vdr-imonlcd-0.0.1.tgz
#> ln -s imonlcd-0.0.1 imon

Compile the plugin (from VDR's source directory)

Change the working directory to VDR source root and compile this plugin 
like all other VDR plugins.

#> cd $VDRSOURCE
#> make plugins

After everything has been compiled without errors, copy the plugin to their 
target directory.

#> make install


Check follow requirements 
-------------------------
* module lirc_imon is loaded
* /dev/lcd0 still exits
* /dev/lcd0 are writable

* To determine need protocol to communicate with LCD, known values
  0038 - For LCD with ID 15c2:0038 SoundGraph Inc (default)
  ffdc - For LCD with ID 15c2:ffdc SoundGraph Inc

  #> lsusb | grep 15c2
  Bus 002 Device 002: ID 15c2:0038 SoundGraph Inc. 

  or by udev      
  #> udevinfo -a -n /dev/lcd0 \
  | grep -2 'ATTRS{idVendor}=="15c2"' \
  | grep ATTRS{idProduct} | cut -d '=' -f 3
  "0038"


Start VDR with the plugin.

You have to specify the device and protocol of your display in the config file
on the command line.
Possible options are:
